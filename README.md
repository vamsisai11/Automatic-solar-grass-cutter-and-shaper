# Automatic-solar-grass-cutter-and-shaper
Arduino based Solar powered Grasscutter designed to cut grass. The Grasscutter is designed through using LIDAR and solar, which is controlled remotely through  Bluetooth module.
The model consists of hardware components like Arduino NANO, Solar panel, DC motor, motor driver, IR sensors ,rechargeable batteries and Bluetooth module. The designed model is programmed through Arduino IDE to control the operation of the Grasscutter. The control mechanism and movements such as Forward movement, Backward movement, Right movement, Left movement, On mechanism, Off mechanism and Stop function for the Grasscutter prototype. An LIDAR connected to the head of the model avoids the system from colliding with obstacles while in movement.
The system introduces a paradigm shift in lawn maintenance with the development of a solar-powered grass-cutting robot incorporating Bluetooth connectivity. Solar panels are integrated into the design to harness renewable energy from the sun, reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional fuel-powered alternatives. Bluetooth technology is employed for wireless communication, allowing users to control and monitor the robot remotely using a smartphone or dedicated control unit. The robot is equipped with automated navigation features, leveraging sensors for obstacle detection and ensuring efficient coverage of the lawn. AI-based cutting algorithms enable precise and adaptive cutting patterns based on grass height and density. The system also prioritizes safety with emergency stop mechanisms and obstacle avoidance, while efficient energy management optimizes the use of solar power. The user-friendly interface, environmental considerations, and potential for future upgrades make the proposed system a more sustainable, efficient, and technologically advanced solution for lawn maintenance.
